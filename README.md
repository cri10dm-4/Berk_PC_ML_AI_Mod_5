**Stated Problem:**
Analyzed key characteristics and behaviors influencing customers' decisions to accept Bar and Coffee House coupons.

**Visualizations demonstrating acceptance differences:**
**Bar Coupons:**

Bar visit frequency and acceptance rates.

Acceptance by age and passenger type.

Acceptance among income groups.

**Coffee House Coupons:**

Acceptance rates by visit frequency.

Acceptance rates by income level.

Passenger type impact on acceptance.

**Interpretation of Descriptive and Inferential Statistics:**
Frequent visitors to Bars (≥ 4 visits/month) demonstrated acceptance rates ~77%, significantly higher compared to infrequent visitors (~38%).

Younger drivers (under 30), without kids or partners, accepted bar coupons more (~76%).

Moderate-income groups (particularly between $37,500–$99,999) were notably receptive to Coffee House coupons (acceptance rates ~56%), indicating price sensitivity and value appreciation.

Coupon acceptance was highest when passengers were friends or partners (~58-60%) compared to kids or being alone (~43%).

**Clearly Highlighted Actionable Recommendations:**
Bars: Target young adults under 30, particularly regular bar visitors without family passengers.

Coffee Houses: Emphasize moderate-income individuals and leverage social contexts by targeting drivers accompanied by friends or partners.

**Next Steps and Recommendations:**
Explore coupon acceptance across specific times (weekends vs. weekdays) and conditions (weather, traffic).

Implement personalization strategies: tailor coupons based on user's frequency of visits and social contexts (passengers type).

Conduct further analysis of other coupon categories (restaurants, takeaways) to deepen insights and broaden targeting strategies.
